          <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 1.50em">T</span>o Sherlock Holmes she
          is always <i>the</i> woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other
          name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was
          not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and
          that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably
          balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing
          machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in
          a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a
          sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing
          the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to
          admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was
          to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental
          results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own
          high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a
          nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was
          the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
          </p>

          <p class="letter">
          “MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took
          me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But
          then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been
          warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an
          agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with
          all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became
          suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.
          But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is
          nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent
          John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as
          I call them, and came down just as you departed.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an
          object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather
          imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my
          husband.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by
          so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call
          to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am
          loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance
          from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and
          to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
          take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I
          remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
          </p>

          <p class="right">
          “Very truly yours,<br>
          “IRENE NORTON, <i>née</i> ADLER.”
          </p>

          <p class="p2">
          “What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia,
          when we had all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick
          and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a
          pity that she was not on my level?”
          </p>

          <p>
          “I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I
          have the honour to wish you a very good morning.” He bowed, and, turning
          away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set
          off in my company for his chambers.
          </p>

          <p class="p2">
          And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia,
          and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman’s
          wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard
          him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her
          photograph, it is always under the honourable title of <i>the</i> woman.
